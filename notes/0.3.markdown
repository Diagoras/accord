Version 0.3 contains significant internal and API improvements:

* [https://github.com/wix/accord/issues/7] Added library provisioning for null safety. This is a breaking API change (though user code that doesn't explicitly decompose `Failure`s should not be affected), as follows:
** The `Validator[-T]` trait is now significantly leaner, essentially reduced to a function `T => Result`;
** `Failure`s now comprise a `Set` of violations (previously a `Seq`);
** A `BaseValidator[T]` abstract class is provided in the _core_ module, along with `ViolationBuilder`. Both significantly simplify the implementation of combinators;
** A `NullSafeValidator[T <: AnyRef]` is also provided. It handles null checks and provides a default failure for nulls;
** Since there's no way to enforce null-awareness at the type-system level, adapting a validator (via the `compose` method) requires the provided function to be null-safe at the contract level.

Feedback, bug reports and improvements are welcome!
