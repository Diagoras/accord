Version 0.2 of Accord is out, featuring the following improvements:

* String validation DSL rewritten to actually be useful;
* Collection DSL operations like `each` now apply to all collection-like structures; this is especially useful to define "none-or-valid" predicates for `Option`s;
* Validator contract changed to properly reflect the fact that validators are contravariant (i.e. a `Validator[Animal]` is also a `Validator[Cat]`).
* Transformation macro partially rewritten using [quasiquotes](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/quasiquotes.html). Consequently, it is leaner and much more readable;
* DSL codebase refactored to make extension and modification easier.

Feedback, bug reports and improvements are welcome!
